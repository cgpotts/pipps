Meanings of elements:

SPURTING with the NEEDLE  
...or: SPURTING in ROTATION  
...or: ERECT, THRUSTING FORWARD and SCREWING, TWISTING

""spurting with the needle"" describes a bougie reaming session: scarring from sexually transmitted diseases can cause both a shortened penis and a bent or curled penis, especially when attempting to become erect; this scarring can be removed somewhat by reaming the urethra with a long, thin rasp file, known as a BOUGIE; gonorrhea and other such diseases cause scar tissue to form within the urethra

""spurting in rotation"" used as an element meaning GRUNT-LEVEL FOOT SOLDIER, perhaps as they are being slaughtered by an enemy; as ""multiplied twisting"" wields a weapon, perhaps a forward-thrusting spearing tool, or may refer to the fact that the 'all-volunteer army system' sometimes needed to conscript foot soldiers using strong-arm twisting tactics to go and DIE as SERVANTS of the lord, FINALLY, AT LAST

""nine, spurting and screwing"" is the simplified replacement for 卒, 率, and 卛: ""palming head while following submissively and obediently in rotation"" preparing one's erection while waiting in queue outside the meat wagons of so-called 'COMFORT WOMEN' as the LOWEST RANK SERVANT (undeniably, a person cannot get lower than that) ...during World War II, Japanese soldiers were each allotted three minutes with a comfort woman, hence there was literally no time to lose, time was of the essence, and so on; ""palming head while in line for screwing the service provider"" also in that case meaning FINALLY, AT LAST arriving on cloud nine, TO DIE FOR taking their turn with the LOWEST SLAVES for ""spurting in rotation"" with foot soldiers; it is noteworthy that these are all _Chinese_ glyphs, indicating that the Japanese did not invent the concept of comfort women ...rather, all armies used them in the past; this glyph with 'person' 伜 means 'penis, punk')

some scholars say this glyph was also used to represent a twisting device that needed a strong arm to twist hemp fibers into rope that were collected from processed cannabis stalks, but that interpretation seems a bit inadequate to explain the given meanings

military use of comfort women was not a Japanese invention, originally ...everyone did it: pirates, bandits, gangs, armies the world over ...because they _could_ ; see this researcher's website blog and well-documented published material to learn about the relationship between Japan and Korea prior to WWII, who it was that actually recruited Korean women as army service providers (in nearly all cases), and who is behind why this issue remains a propaganda flashpoint today:
